doublelucky's first attempt at INTERSPECIES Theater. Originally set to premiere at the HAU but cancelled due to Corona. The garden will be shown in a modified version at the Stiftung Nantesbuch during the Moosbrand Literature und Musikfest. The Garden is a place to explore the Idea that the data in your phone is alive. A wiggling squirming part of our Biome that it's time to get to know.
