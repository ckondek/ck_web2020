Data Theater is a provisional concept. For the moment it refers to all performance events that directly use data given up by the the audience of these performances. The data can be donated freely or "sniffed" invisibly. Ideally however the data gathered should be revealed and presented back to this audience. All theater tries to relate to those things that make up the world of it's audience.  For the early greeks the relations between the Gods and their relations to man was the essential reality. For Brecht it was economic and social conditions. For Artaud the lived body was paramount. Data Theater acknowledges that the primary mode for representing people in todays society are those ever expanding private collections of monetizable data. Making this data visible & present is its mission.
