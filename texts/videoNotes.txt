The key is simply this: A Video cannot only be it's content, or cannot be simply it's content.

A video, at least on stage, is not there to show something. If a video only shows what is there it's a bad video. A video on stage always has to do something, or create something. It has to be its own event. It has to have a side that is mysterious, that is withdrawn, that promises much more than it shows. Naturally a video always shows something, but a literal transmission of that thing shown saying nothing else than I am am here and I look like this is the first and biggest mistake of all video on stage.
