We made DEAD CAT BOUNCE in 2004. With DCB we tried to tap into the world of Financial Market using the audience's money as our start-up capital. We would count the box office of the evening. "There are 80 of you here tonight, 5 got in for free, 6 paid student prices. that makes a total of 765 Euros." This we would convert to dollars and between 8:30pm and 10:00pm, (2:30pm to 4pm New York time), we would try to make 1% profit for the audience. Trading live and making realtime decisions.   The market itself created the dramaturgy for the piece. About half the time we did indeed make 1% fo the audience. And of course we always split the profits with the audience. Although 1% of 15 euro ticket in itself was not so exciting, if you think that back then your bank was giving you 3% a year, and now even less, 1% was quite a good show. The show was developed mainly at the Productiehuis at the  Rotterdamse Schouwburg under the leadership of Annemie Vanackere. That was following a start up phase at the Plateau Festival in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt, which was run by Thomas Frank. The show was also first performance at the then newly created HAU in Berlin.
